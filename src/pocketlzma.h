    IMPORTANT - YOU MUST #define POCKETLZMA_LZMA_C_DEFINE exactly ONCE before the first time you include "pocketlzma.hpp"
    The reason for this is that the base logic used by PocketLzma is written i C (by Igor Pavlov), thus this is required
    to make sure the implementations are included only once. In other words: If pocketlzma.hpp is included several places,
    the #define must not be included anywhere but in one of them.

    Example:
    #define POCKETLZMA_LZMA_C_DEFINE
    #include "pocketlzma.hpp"
